# keyboard-configuartor

intercept keycodes and change them to emulate qmk/oryx zsa like behaviour with any keyboard

## TODO
 - testing for keyboard_modifier
 - automatic start of interception in main func
 - some sort of examples usw


## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Installation
dependencies
 - yaml-cpp
 - evdev
 - interception-tools

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
 - config creator would be nice if it has a gui web based
 - pipeline for gui when done
 - general options for something like autoshift
 - support for mouse output through keyboard
 - layer system
 - led control for layers usw

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
